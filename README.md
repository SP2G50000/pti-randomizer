# PTI Randomizer
A simple CLI tool for generating a list of elements to use in your custom Portal 2 (or Rexaura) puzzles.

This is a Rust rewrite of an old, unpublished Python project of mine. This was mostly done as an exercise to learn Rust.

## Installation Instructions
A Windows executable is provided in the releases section, but if you're on Linux or macOS or are just looking to compile it yourself, here are the instructions:
* Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/).
* Install [Rust](https://rustup.rs/).
* Clone this repo to your computer using `git clone https://github.com/SP2G50000/pti-randomizer.git`.
* Navigate to the root directory of the project and run `cargo build`.
* Navigate to the build directory. The compiled program will be located there.
