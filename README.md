# PTI Randomizer
A simple CLI tool for generating a list of elements to use in your custom Portal 2 (or Rexaura) puzzles.

This is a Rust rewrite of an old, unpublished Python project of mine. This was mostly done as an exercise to learn Rust.

## Installation Instructions
* Install Git.
* Install Rust.
* Navigate to the directory the project is stored in and run `cargo build`.
* Navigate to the build directory, and your project should be there.
